## Garfield Extension for Firefox

Taken inspiration from bogoblin (Creator of this extension) to come up with this project  


## Compilation instructions

All that is needed is to run "node ./compile.js", this packs everything into the extension.js file, so the files needed for the addon to work are manifest.json, launch.js and extension.js.
